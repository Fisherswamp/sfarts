## Joining or Creating a Lobby
  Create a lobby by using the interface in the bottom left of the screen; name your lobby and select the map you wish to play on. Created lobbies will appear in a list in the center of the screen. After your opponent has joined the lobby, "Players" will be 2/2 and you can start get started. Only the lobby manager, usually the one who originially created the lobby, may start the game. 
  
 # How To Play
 
 ## Turns
  In TBSFARTS turns are taken simultaneously. When both players have commited their orders to their units, the orders of both sides are executed at the same time, and if neither player wins, the next turn begins.
  
 ## Units
  Currently, TBSFARTS features three kinds of units: 
  1. Destroyer - A mighty, but slow-moving capital ship.
  2. Fighter - A mid-range unit that strikes the balance between firepower and speed.
  3. Speeder - A fragile, but fast-moving unit, capable of outmanuvering the enemy.
  
  Stats - every unit has 5 stats. Select a Unit to see it's stats
  1. Energy: The amount of tiles a unit can move before it has to recharge (units recharge at the start of every turn). This is also displayed in a yellow bar above the unit.
  2. Health: The amount of damage a unit can take. At zero, the unit is destroyed. This is also displayed in a green bar above the unit
  3. Range: The distance a unit can attack from.
  4. Damage: The damage this unit inflicts when it attacks.
  5. Ammo Remaining: The amount of attacks this unit can make before it must reload (units reload at the start of every turn). Currently, all units have 1 ammo.
  
  ## Selecting Units
    
   Left-click a unit to select it and right-click to deselect.
  
  ## Combat
    
  Units may attack and then move but they may not move before attacking. To attack, select the unit you wish to attack with and press "A." If there are any enemy units in
  range, they will be highlighted in red. Simply click the target to inflict damage. It is important to remember that this is just a preview of the actions that take place
  when the turn ends, combat and movement do not actually resolve until both players end their turn.
    
  ## Movement
  
   To move a unit, select it, and move your mouse to its desired destination. If your unit has enough energy remaining to reach it, the projected route will appear, and you
   just need to click the destination to move. Again, it is important to remember that this is just a preview of the actions that take place when the turn ends, combat and
   movement do not actually resolve until both players end their turn.
    
  ## Reset Moves
  
   If you change your mind, or make a move by mistake, you may click "Reset Moves" at the top of the screen. This returns the game to how it appeared at the beggining of the
   turn and you may issue your orders again.
    
  ## End Turn
  
   When you are finished, select "End Turn" at the top of the screen, next to "Reset Moves." When both players have ended their turns, all combat and movement is resolved.
   If a Main Base is destroyed, the game ends.
    
  ## Winning The Game
    
   The game is won, when a player reduces the health of the opponent's main base to zero or when one player concedes. To concede, press the red buttom at the top of the
   screen next to "Reset Moves," labeled "Concede."

We hope you enjoy TBSFARTS!
